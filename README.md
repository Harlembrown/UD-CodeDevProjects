The S3 bucket is visible in the AWS Management console.
All website files should be added to the S3 bucket.
I have submitted screenshot showing all the website files uploaded to the newly created S3 bucket.
The bucket configuration is set up to support static website hosting.
The S3 bucket is configured to support static website hosting.
The permission access to the bucket should be configured to allow public access.
The S3 bucket has an IAM bucket policy that makes the bucket contents publicly accessible.

The website is distributed via Cloudfront.
CloudFront has been configured to retrieve and distribute website files.
Web Browser Access
The website is publicly accessible to anyone on the Internet via a web browser.

To Make Your Project Stand Out I customize my website by changing some of the text. The name is “Columbus Pressley's Travel Blog”.
I also changed the background image of my website to display my favorite vacation photo of downtown Miami, FL.
