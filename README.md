This is my first Udacity Code Developer Nanodegree Project to Deploy a Static Website on AWS S3

CRITERIA
I have met the required SPECIFICATIONS per the rubrics as follows:

Created a S3 bucket.
The S3 bucket is visible in the AWS Management console.
All website files should be added to the S3 bucket.
I have submitted screenshot showing all the website files uploaded to the newly created S3 bucket.
The bucket configuration is set up to support static website hosting.
The S3 bucket is configured to support static website hosting.
The permission access to the bucket should be configured to allow public access.
The S3 bucket has an IAM bucket policy that makes the bucket contents publicly accessible.
Website Distribution
The website is distributed via Cloudfront.
CloudFront has been configured to retrieve and distribute website files.
Web Browser Access
The website is publicly accessible to anyone on the Internet via a web browser. 
Here is my CloudFront endpoint URL for the website: http://djrsbtt8ma9p0.cloudfront.net/
To make my project stand out I customized my website by naming it “Columbus Pressley's Travel Blog”.
I also changed the background image of my website to display my favorite vacation photo of downtown Miami, FL.
